# Creature Power Levels Sorting Program

## Overview
This Java program is designed for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course **Final Exam**. It handles the sorting and management of creatures based on their power levels using Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithms. The program organizes the data for 5 predefined creatures, sorts their power levels in both descending and ascending order, and displays the sorted lists. Additionally, it uses a Stack data structure to store and pop the creatures in descending order of their power levels.

## Features
1. **Input Data (Fixed)**: 
   - The program uses the following creatures and their respective power levels:
     - Dragon - 95
     - Griffin - 88
     - Unicorn - 78
     - Phoenix - 92
     - Centaur - 85

2. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - **Bubble Sort**: Sorts the power levels in **descending order**.
   - **Selection Sort**: Sorts the power levels in **ascending order**.

3. **Stack Implementation**:
   - Using either the Bubble Sort or Selection Sort, all creatures are pushed onto a **stack**.
   - The creatures are then popped from the stack and displayed in **descending order** based on their power levels.

4. **Output**:
   - Displays the sorted lists in both **ascending** and **descending** orders.
   - Shows the creatures popped from the stack in **descending order** by power level.
